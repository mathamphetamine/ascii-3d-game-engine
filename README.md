# ascii-3d-game-engine
 This is an experimental project where I built a 3D rendering game engine using ASCII characters. This project was sorta fun and provided an introduction into the world of game development, focusing on creating a retro-style first-person shooter (FPS) game. The engine utilizes ASCII characters to represent different elements of the scene and employs raytracing to calculate perspectives, distances, and shading in real-time. Despite its simplicity, it showcases fundamental concepts in graphics rendering, collision detection, and game mechanics.
